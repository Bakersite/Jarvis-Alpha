# Jarvis-Alpha
Jarvis ver.Alpha

In this initial iteration of Jarvis, I've developed a voice assistant previously. Previously, I utilized the OpenAI API for its voice recognition capabilities, but was constrained by the free version's limited 100 credit allocation per user. Upon exhausting these credits, I found myself at a loss as to how to create a voice assistant. However, my search led me to Huggingface, a platform that enables users to share their AI models in an open-source format, similar to GitHub but specialized for machine learning models.
